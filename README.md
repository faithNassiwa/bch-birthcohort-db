# Harmonization of Large Birth Cohort Datasets for Prediction of Nutritional Impacts on Childhood Neurocognitive Outcomes
# Summary
The project aims to identify and harmonize datasets from large birth cohorts (>1000 participants) that collected data on nutrition variables during early life and metrics associated with later childhood neurocognitive outcomes. The overarching objective of the project is to source,
download, and harmonize data from these cohorts, creating a comprehensive dataset for
population-level analysis. Within the given timeline, this project will focus on creating a
database framework that can be used to harmonize several sets of data, using 2-3 birth cohorts as initial input, for whom data is publicly available and accessible for download. The purpose of
preparing this database framework is to ensure proper organization and harmonization of datasets for downstream analyses, which may include machine learning and feature selection pipelines to pinpoint the nutritional factors most significantly influencing neurocognitive development.
